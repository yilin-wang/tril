# Trajectory Ranked Imitation Learning

Yi Lin Wang

In this project, I use an inverse reinforcement learning method based on ranked demonstrations for imitation learning, which I call TRIL. This code base is adapted from the original code base for the inverse RL method called T-REX, located [here](https://github.com/hiwonjoon/ICML2019-TREX).
